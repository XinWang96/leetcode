## 973. K Closest Points to Origin
https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

## Description
We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)
```
Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].


Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```

## Methods
At the first time I tried to slove this problem, I took a mistake. We can only use sqrt in double type, so I used the double array, which makes the problem become 
complexity. Acutally, I do not need to use sqrt, I can use the sum instead. There are two methods for the problem.

The first one is to set a new array dis[][], the first element is the distance, the second is the order from the points[][]. Then we sort the new array with the distance.
Then we can get the first K points.

The second is use priority queue, and we will rewrite the method of compare, then we poll K points in this queue.


## Java Code

```
// The first method
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        int[][] dis = new int[points.length][2];
        for(int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            int distance = points[i][0] * points[i][0] + points[i][1] * points[i][1];
            dis[i] = new int[]{distance, i};
        }
        Arrays.sort(dis, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a1, int[] a2) {
                return a1[0] - a2[0];
            }
        });
        int[][] res = new int[K][2];
        for(int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
            int number = dis[i][1];
            res[i] = points[number];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

```
//The second method
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> q = new PriorityQueue<>(new pointComparator());
        for(int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            q.add(points[i]);
        }
        int[][] res = new int[K][2];
        for(int i = 0; i < K; i++) {
            res[i] = q.poll();
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    public class pointComparator implements Comparator<int[]> {
        public int compare(int[] a1, int[] a2) {
            int sum1 = a1[0] * a1[0] + a1[1] * a1[1];
            int sum2 = a2[0] * a2[0] + a2[1] * a2[1];
            return sum1 - sum2;
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity
Time Complexities are both O(NlogN), because it both use sort, while the priority queue method is always faster than the arrary method.
